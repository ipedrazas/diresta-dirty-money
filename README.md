# Diresta: Dirty Money

In 2011 [Jimmy Diresta](https://twitter.com/JimmyDiResta)  co-hosted "Dirty Money" with his brother, comedian John DiResta, on Discovery Channel. The DiResta brothers set out scouring New York City â€“ from the dumpsters of the Lower East Side to flea markets scattered throughout the five boroughs to various antique shops and collectors.

This is a little experiment to see if it's possible to package the whole series from youtube into a Docker container.

The docker image will use the [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) library to download the youtube videos into the container.
